# The Transformation-lab in Xochimilco social-ecological system

Our “Transformation laboratory” (T-Lab) is a participatory space where new agency is activated in relation to a stagnant sustainability challenge to generate intentional bottom-up transformations. The emergence of T-Labs as genuine bottom-up transformative spaces involves changes at multiple levels (individual, collective, social-ecological).

Here we present a set of participatory research tools to elicit and present information that could help agents to see their social-ecological position and role, and to identify the practices they share with others within specific social networks, and spaces of action.

## Cognitive maps metrics per meta-narrative in T0 and T1

Principal components of each narrative: <br /> _Drivers_ (variables with higher outdegree & with higher distance between outdegree and indegree); 
<br /> _Connectors_ (variables with higher betweenness centrality); and, 
<br /> _Receptors_ (variables with higher indegree and with higher distance between indegree and outdegree).

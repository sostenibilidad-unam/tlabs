In our T-Lab project, participants created avatars (e.g., a fantastic animal, a plant, a person, which they illustrated on large sheets of paper and named) based on a set of given and self-identified attributes and capacities (powers).

We devised the avatars concept for three main reasons: 
1. The avatar is a proxy of an agent, and hence represents the agent, but is not the agent per se; it can embody different powers and these can change along the process; 
2. Even if powers have their own meaning as part of an avatar, these acquire more relevance when avatars build synergies with the powers of others; and 
3. When avatars interact, they can come to recognize that they possess other powers that they didnâ€™t know that they had at the beginning of the process.

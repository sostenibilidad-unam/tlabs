| Distilled prominent story from the CM associated to each meta-narrative | Absence (lack of coordination and implementation) institutional and civil society, is the main cause of the abandonment of chinampas and loss of biodiversity. This is because there is no market (for agricultural production to be sustainable), lack of urban services and with it water pollution. Added to this is immigration to the area that precisely does not have urban services, thus polluting the water and causing the disappearance of species. | Similar to _Agriculture viability_, the lack of institutional coordination and poor civil participation, coupled with population growth (probably due to immigration), has led to the loss of soil quality due to irregular settlements and changes in land use of the chinampas. It is to be assumed that irregular settlements and change in land use are connected, since it is the transformation of the chinampa to land use housing. | Population growth and the lack of implementation of policies generate public health problems. Apparently the two causes (drivers) generate a situation of irregular settlements, that there is little participation of society, inequity in access to job opportunities and human migration. | The dynamics of the Xochi SES result in irregular settlements and bad livestock practices. Where its origin is population growth, the inefficiency of civil society participation (but not the lack of…), lack of implementation of public policies and lack of institutional coordination. The connection between causes and effects are the urbanization of the chinampas, intensive agricultural practices and the abandonment of chinampas. | Lack of participation by civil society (followed by bad livestock practices and intensive agricultural activities) are the main causes of the urbanization of chinampas and loss of biodiversity, and water pollution. This is because there is no market (for agricultural production to be sustainable). | The main causes of the problems in the area are due to the lack of implementation of public policies and institutional coordination (that is, they remain exogenous). Because young people do not work in agriculture, chinampas are abandoned, biodiversity is lost and water is polluted. | No data | The scarcity of water stands out as the main driver for the abandonment of chinampas, which in turn, due to the fact that young people do not work in agriculture, causes emigration in the area. On the other hand, the urbanization of the chinampas (due to population growth and lack of implementation of public policies) produces discharge of sewage and solid waste that in turn contributes to water pollution. |

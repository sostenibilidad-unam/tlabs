| Distilled prominent story from the CM associated to each meta-narrative | Absence (lack of coordination and implementation) institutional and civil society, is the main cause of the abandonment of chinampas and loss of biodiversity. This is because there is no market (for agricultural production to be sustainable), lack of urban services and with it water pollution. Added to this is immigration to the area that precisely does not have urban services, thus polluting the water and causing the disappearance of species. | Similar to _Agriculture viability_, the lack of institutional coordination and poor civil participation, coupled with population growth (probably due to immigration), has led to the loss of soil quality due to irregular settlements and changes in land use of the chinampas. It is to be assumed that irregular settlements and change in land use are connected, since it is the transformation of the chinampa to land use housing. | Population growth and the lack of implementation of policies generate public health problems. Apparently the two causes (drivers) generate a situation of irregular settlements, that there is little participation of society, inequity in access to job opportunities and human migration. | The dynamics of the Xochi SES result in irregular settlements and bad livestock practices. Where its origin is population growth, the inefficiency of civil society participation (but not the lack of…), lack of implementation of public policies and lack of institutional coordination. The connection between causes and effects are the urbanization of the chinampas, intensive agricultural practices and the abandonment of chinampas. | Lack of participation by civil society (followed by bad livestock practices and intensive agricultural activities) are the main causes of the urbanization of chinampas and loss of biodiversity, and water pollution. This is because there is no market (for agricultural production to be sustainable). | The main causes of the problems in the area are due to the lack of implementation of public policies and institutional coordination (that is, they remain exogenous). Because young people do not work in agriculture, chinampas are abandoned, biodiversity is lost and water is polluted. | No data | The scarcity of water stands out as the main driver for the abandonment of chinampas, which in turn, due to the fact that young people do not work in agriculture, causes emigration in the area. On the other hand, the urbanization of the chinampas (due to population growth and lack of implementation of public policies) produces discharge of sewage and solid waste that in turn contributes to water pollution. |

| CONNECTION between Q-Methodology and Cognitive Maps | The challenges to make agriculture viable is that, on the one hand, there are no markets and, secondly, the contamination of the water by uncontrolled immigration to the area. As agriculture is not viable, there is an abandonment of chinampas, which could be occupied and become irregular settlements. | Presumably, the loss of soil quality is due to the pollution resulting from the dwellings. It is difficult to connect loss of soil quality that is a biophysical property with the cultural aspect of this metanarrative. The relationship that can be suggested is that the poor quality of the soil leads to the abandonment of the chinampería and with it the loss of traditions and identity. | Looking at the complete CM, it is evident that there is a great coincidence that there is an urban problem related to public health problems due to poor wastewater management, water pollution, and institutional inaction. On the other hand, there is a great coincidence that there is a loss of soil quality due to poor agricultural and livestock practices, as well as wastewater disposal. Looking at the full CM it is easy to see the relationship between the Q and MC results. |The main idea is that population growth, with an inefficient civil society, lack of institutional coordination and without the implementation of public policies, causes the abandonment and urbanization of the chinampas. It is not clear how with such a negative vision in the CM it can be compatible with the good state of the system. | Agricultural practices, although desirable, when intensive (i.e., use of greenhouses and pesticides) generate water pollution and its associated loss of biodiversity. As the urbanization is not compatible, the chinampas cannot be converted to another land use. | In both Q and CM, the role of young people who do not work in agriculture (due to lack of market) stands out, and therefore, this causes abandonment of chinampas. | No data | There is no obvious connection between the Q and the MC, only in the institutional part (i.e., lack of implementation of public policies and institutional coordination). Although in the CM the loss of cultural values is linked to the fact that young people do not work in agriculture and therefore migrate, it is not very prominent with respect to the other variables (and this component is not highlighted as it is in the Q). |

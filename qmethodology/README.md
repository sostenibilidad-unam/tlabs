# TLabs - Q-Methodology

Arguments: 28 statements, 14 Q-sorts, “FALSE” forced distribution, 4 factors, 
varimax rotation, automatic flagging and Pearson correlation coefficient. 

## Relation between Q-sorts and factors

LOA-Factor loadings for Q-sorts. Indicates the relationship between each Q-sort 
and component or factor (using “varimax” rotation function).

## Cognitive maps metrics per meta-narrative in T0 and T1

Principal components of each narrative: 
Drivers (variables with higher outdegree & with higher distance between outdegree and indegree); 
Connectors (variables with higher betweenness centrality); and, 
Receptors (variables with higher indegree and with higher distance between indegree and outdegree).
